# EDA - Customer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores customer purchasing behavior in an e-commerce dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The goal is to uncover patterns in revenue, order values, and customer behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

## Dataset

- Source: [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
- Main tables used: customers, orders, order_payments, and order_items

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Key Analysis

- Revenue distribution and outlier detection
- Customer purchase frequency
- Identification of high-value customers
- Order value distribution

## Key Insights

- Revenue is highly concentrated among a small group of customers
- Most customers make only one purchase
- Order values are right-skewed with significant high-value outliers

## Business Recommendations

- Develop loyalty programs to convert one-time buyers into repeat customers
- Reduce dependency on high-value outliers by targeting mid-value customers
- Monitor large transaction for potential fraud or enterprise opportunities

## Output

- Google Colab Notebook with full EDA
- Visualizations highlight customer behavior patterns
